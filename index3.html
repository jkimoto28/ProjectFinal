        Tulips - vibrant, cup-shaped flowers from the genus Tulipa, part of the lily family, and are celebrated for their simplicity and elegance. Native to Central Asia and the Mediterranean, tulips have a rich cultural history, especially in the Netherlands, where they sparked "Tulip Mania" in the 17th century, one of the earliest recorded economic bubbles.

        Sunflowers - tall, bright, and cheerful flowers that are instantly recognizable by their large, daisy-like heads and vibrant yellow petals surrounding a dark, seed-filled center. Native to North and South America, sunflowers are known for their ability to follow the sun throughout the day, a behavior called heliotropism, especially when they are young. This unique trait symbolizes loyalty, longevity, and warmth.
